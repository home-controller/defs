# defs
Some information on the board being used. e.g. the on board memory amounts for different types of memory.

I think there might better ways? But if I want to be able to swap between different IDEs(vscode,Arduino etc.) and boards like Arduino/esp/RP2040 and maybe use command line with no IDE like CMake for the RP2040 I thought it might be a good idea to have all of this in 1 file.

That way any porting or changes would be easier, I hope :)
