# defs
Some information on the board being used. e.g. the on board memory ammounts for different types of memory.

I think there are probaly better ways but if I want to be able to swap betwean different IDEs and boards like Arduino/esp/RP2040 and maybe use command line like CMake for the RP2040 I thought I might be a good idea to have all of this in 1 file.
